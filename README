Tests for various libraries that use the World of Warcraft Community Platform API:

http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2626217/

These tests are intended to provide a way for devleopers to test various libraries
that implement the community platform API.

The tests were developed to run on an ec2 node booted into Linux. Picking AMI(s)
for testing was done by logging into the EC2 console:
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home
and then browsing the list of public AMIs for a recent CentOS AMI from rightscale:
Images -> AMIs -> All Images -> Cent OS -> rightscale (search text)


Start off by booting up a small (m1.small) instance on ec2 to run the tests.
Since this is a m1.small node use a 32bit image: ami-90f607f9
If this were a 64bit node the 64bit version is:  ami-9ae312f3

ec2-run-instances \
  ami-90f607f9  \
  --key second \
  --group quick-start-1 \
  --instance-type m1.small

Once it is booted up log in as root and run the scripts that install the languages
that are used by the libraries that use the community platform API.

Many of the install scripts will download the sources and compile from scratch.
This can take a while to install. On a m1.small node that is installing Java,
JavaScript (Rhino), PHP and three versions each of Python and Ruby the process
takes 

Download the scripts:
wget \
  https://github.com/paca-project/warcraft-community-platform-tests/tarball/master \
  --no-check-certificate

Unpack the scripts and put the CentOS-5.4 directory in ~:
tar zxf master
mv paca-project-warcraft-community-platform-tests-*/CentOS-5.4 ~

Run the scripts:
cd ~/CentOS-5.4/
chmod u+x install-all.bash 
./install-all.bash

This will result in a machine with Java, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby and Python
installed that should be able to test a wide variety of libraries that use
the community platform API.

The install-all.bash script should take roughly 30-40 minutes to run on a m1.small
ec2 node (most of that time spent compiling multiple versions of Ruby and Python)
and it should produce output that looks like this:
